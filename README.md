About the Project 🌟

This is a Real-Time Chat Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with Socket.io for seamless real-time messaging. The app allows users to chat privately with friends or contacts instantly.

Sensitive information like MongoDB URI and JWT secret is securely stored in a .env file 🔒. The frontend is fully responsive and interactive, designed with React + Tailwind CSS for a modern look.

This project is a great demonstration of full-stack development, real-time communication, and secure authentication, perfect for a final-year B.Tech portfolio. 💻

Installation & Setup ⚙️

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git


Install dependencies:

# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install


Setup Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add:

MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>


Start the Application:

# Start backend server
cd backend
npm start

# Start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev


Open in Browser:
Visit http://localhost:5173 to start chatting 💬

How It Works 🔄

The frontend (React + Tailwind CSS) handles user interaction, forms, and displays messages.

The backend (Node.js + Express.js) manages user authentication, stores messages in MongoDB, and ensures secure API communication.

Socket.io enables real-time bidirectional communication so that messages appear instantly for both sender and receiver.

All sensitive data like database credentials and JWT secrets are stored in .env to ensure security.

Future Improvements 🚀
